</html><p>“The brains of people are more interesting than the looks I think,” Hollywood actress and inventor Hedy Lamarr in 1990.
The striking movie star may be most well-known for her roles in the 1940s Oscar-nominated films ‘Algiers’ and ‘Sampson and Delilah.’ But it is her technical mind that is her greatest legacy.LaMarr’s life story is indeed remarkable.
    </p>
    <p><strong>November 9, 1914:</strong>Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the only child of Gertrud "Trude" Kiesler (1894–1977) and Emil Kiesler (1880–1935). Her father was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was a successful bank director.
    </p>
    <p><strong></strong> The daughter of a prosperous Viennese banker, Lamarr was privately tutored from age 4; by the time she was 10, she was a proficient pianist and dancer and could speak four languages.</p>
    <p><strong>1930:</strong> At age 16 she enrolled in Max Reinhardt’s Berlin-based dramatic school, and within a year she made her motion picture debut in Geld auf der Strasse
    </p>
    <p><strong>1933: </strong>At age 18, Lamarr was given the lead in Gustav Machatý's film, Ecstasy. She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man. Although she was shocked and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award in Rome. Throughout Europe, it was regarded an artistic work.</p>
    <p><strong>1934:</strong> she married her first husband at age 19. Unhappily married to an affluent, domineering munitions manufacturer, LaMarr fled their home by bicycle in the middle of the night.</p>
    <p><strong>1937: </strong>She emigrated to the U.S. in the lead up to World War II and caught the eye of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer on the ship from London to New York. LaMarr spoke little English but talked her way into a lucrative contract to act in Hollywood films. The Viennese beauty soon settled into life in Beverly Hills and socialized with luminaries including John F. Kennedy and Howard Hughes, who provided her with equipment to run experiments in her trailer during her downtime from acting. It was in this scientific environment that LaMarr found her true calling.
    </p>
    <p><strong>1939:</strong> At the beginning of World War II, she and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. 
        LaMarr’s work as an inventor was barely publicized in the 1940s, 
        “A powerful lady who is sexy, but smart…  It is really scary for most guys,” Dr. Nyeck says. “You just expose how weak we are.”
        </p>
    <p><strong>1941:</strong> Come Live With Me: Starring James Stewart and Hedy Lamarr. Based on a story by Virginia Van Upp, the film is about a beautiful Viennese refugee seeking United States citizenship who arranges a marriage of convenience with a struggling writer.

    </p>
    <p><strong>1966: </strong>Her autobiography, Ecstasy and Me, was published in 1966, although she said on TV that it was not written by her, and much of it was fictional.</p>

    <p><strong> May 20, 1998:</strong> Bluetooth Comes Out Invented with Hedy Lamarrs design as a base.</p>
    <p><strong>Jan 19, 2000:</strong> Hedy Lamarr Passes Away aged 85 . Although she was married six times (her husbands included screenwriter Gene Markey and actor John Loder) but was living alone at the time of her death.</p>
    <p>She was so ahead of her time with being a feminist,” says Loder in ‘Bombshell.’ “She has never been called that, but, she certainly was.”</p>
